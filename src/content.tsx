amended by redesignating subsections (j), ( k ) , a n d (1) as subsections
(P)^ (q)i ^^^ ( r ) , respectively, and by adding after subsection (i) the
following:
"(j) The term 'adequate notice', as used in section 133, means a
printed notice to a cardholder which sets forth the pertinent facts
clearly and conspicuously so that a person against whom it is to
operate could reasonably be expected to have noticed it and understood
its meaning. Such notice may be given to a cardholder by printing
the notice on any credit card, or on each periodic statement of account,
issued to the cardholder, or by any other means reasonably assuring
the receipt thereof by the cardholder.
" ( k ) The term 'credit card' means any card, plate, coupon book or
other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money,

SEC. 502. (a) The Truth in Lending Act (82 Stat. 146) is amended
by adding after section 131 the following sections:
"§ 132. Issuance of credit cards
"No credit card shall be issued except in response to a request or
application therefor. This prohibition does not apply to the issuance
of a credit card in renewal of, or in substitution for, an accepted
credit card.
"§133. Liability of holder of credit card
" ( a ) A cardholder shall be liable for the unauthorized use of a
credit card only if the card is an accepted credit card, the liability is
not in excess of $50, the card issuer gives adequate notice to the cardholder of the potential liability, the card issuer has provided the
cardholder with a self-addressed, prestamped notification to be mailed
by the cardholder in the event of the loss or theft of the credit card,
and the unauthorized use occurs before the cardholder has notified
the card issuer that an unauthorized use of the credit card has occurred
or may occur as the result of loss, theft, or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no cardholder shall be liable for the unauthorized use
of any credit card which was issued on or after the effective date of
this section, and, after the expiration of twelve months following such
effective date, no cardholder shall be liable for the unauthorized use
of any credit card regardless of the date of its issuance, unless (1) the
conditions of liability specified in the preceding sentence are met, and
(2) the card issuer has provided a method whereby the user of such
card can be identified as the person authorized to use it. For the
purposes of this section, a cardholder notifies a card issuer by taking
such steps as may be reasonably required in the ordinary course of
business to provide the card issuer with the pertinent information
whether or not any particular officer, employee, or agent of the card
issuer does in fact receive such information.

"(b) I n any action by a card issuer to enforce liability for the use of
a credit card, the burden of proof is upon the card issuer to show that
the use was authorized or, if the use was unauthorized, then the burden
of proof is upon the card issuer to show that the conditions of liability
for the unauthorized use of a credit card, as set forth in subsection ( a ) ,
have been met.
"(c) Nothing in this section imposes liability upon a cardholder for
the unauthorized use of a credit card in excess of his liability for
such use under other applicable law or under any agreement with
the card issuer.
" ( d ) Except as provided in this section, a cardholder incurs no
liability from the unauthorized use of a credit card.
"§134. Fraudulent use of credit card
"Whoever, in a transaction affecting interstate or foreign commerce,
uses any counterfeit, fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained credit card to obtain goods or services, or both, having

1132

PUBLIC LAW 91-508-OCT. 26, 1970

[84 STAT.

against any consumer reporting agency, any user of information, or
any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency,
based on information disclosed pursuant to section 609, 610, or 615,
except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent
to injure such consumer.
"§ 611. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy
" (a) If the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in his file is disputed by a consumer, and such dispute is directly
conveyed to the consumer reporting agency by the consumer, the consumer reporting agency shall within a reasonable period of time
reinvestigate and record the current status of that information unless
it has reasonable grounds to believe that the dispute by the consumer
is frivolous or irrelevant. If after such reinvestigation such information is found to be inaccurate or can no longer be verified, the consumer
reporting agency shall promptly delete such information. The presence of contradictory information in the consumer's file does not in
and of itself constitute reasonable grounds for believing the dispute is
frivolous or irrelevant.
"(b) If the reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute, the consumer may file a brief statement setting forth the nature of the dispute.
The consumer reporting agency may limit such statements to not more
than one hundred words if it provides the consumer with assistance in
writing a clear summary of the dispute.
"(c) Whenever a statement of a dispute is filed, unless there is
reasonable grounds to believe that it is frivolous or irrevelant, the
consumer reporting agency shall, in any subsequent consumer report
containing the information in question, clearly note that it is disputed by the consumer and provide either the consumer's statement
or a clear and accurate codification or summary thereof,
" ( d ) Following any deletion of information which is found to be
inaccurate or whose accuracy can no longer be verified or any notation
as to disputed information, the consumer reporting agency shall, at
the request of the consumer, furnish notification that the item has
been deleted or the statement, codification or summary pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) to any person specifically designated by the
consumer who has within two years prior thereto received a consumer report for employment purposes, or within six months prior
thereto received a consumer report for any other purpose, which
contained the deleted or disputed information. The consumer reporting agency shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the consumer his rights to make such a request. Such disclosure shall be
made at or prior to the time the information is deleted or the consumer's statement regarding the disputed information is received.
"§ 612. Charges for certain disclosures
"A consumer reporting agency shall make all disclosures pursuant
to section 609 and furnish all consumer reports pursuant to section
611(d) without charge to the consumer if, within thirty days after
receipt by such consumer of a notification pursuant to section 615 or
notification from a debt collection agency affiliated with such consumer reporting agency stating that the consumer's credit rating may
be or has been adversely affected, the consumer makes a request under
section 609 or 611(d). Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency
may impose a reasonable charge on the consumer for making disclosure to such consumer pursuant to section 609, the charge for which
shall be indicated to the consumer prior to making disclosure; and
for furnishing notifications, statements, summaries, or codifications
to person designated by the consumer pursuant to section 611(d), the
charge for which shall be indicated to the consumer prior to furnish-

84 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 91-508-OCT. 26, 1970

ing such information and shall not exceed the charge that the consumer reporting agency would impose on each designated recipient
for a consumer report except that no charge may be made for notifying
such persons of the deletion of information which is found to be
inaccurate or which can no longer be verified.
"§613. Public record information for employment purposes
"A consumer reporting agency which furnishes a consumer report
for employment purposes and which for that purpose compiles and
reports items of information on consumers which are matters of
public record and are likely to have an adverse effect upon a consumer's ability to obtain employment shall—
"(1) at the time such public record information is reported to
the user of such consumer report, notify the consumer of the fact
that public record information is being reported by the consumer
reporting agency, together with the name and address of the person to whom such information is being reported; or
"(2) maintain strict procedures designed to insure that whenever public record information which is likely to have an adverse
effect on a consumer's ability to obtain employment is reported
it is complete and up to date. For purposes of this paragraph,
items of public record relating to arrests, indictments, convictions, suits, tax liens, and outstanding judgments shall be considered up to date if the current public record status of the item
at the time of the report is reported.
"§614. Restrictions on investigative consumer reports
"Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares an investigative
consumer report, no adverse information in the consumer report (other
than information which is a matter of public record) may be included
in a subsequent consumer report unless such adverse information has
been verified in the process of making such subsequent consumer
report, or the adverse information was received within the threemonth period preceding the date the subsequent report is furnished.
"§615. Requirements on users of consumer reports
" ( a ) Whenever credit or insurance for personal, family, or household purposes, or employment involving a consumer is denied or the
charge for such credit or insurance is increased either wholly or partly

  notGoodIdea:
    "Probably not. If an attacker knows the source text above and knows it contains bitcoin, that may represent a significant advantage for an attacker. When generating a seed it is considered best practice to choose from the widest possible entropy. On top of this, valid seed phrases contain a check-sum. This means that you can not simply choose a seed phrase you like, it must first be valid. So, unless the text above has all 2048 words in the BIP39 standard, it draws from less entropy and is less secure. Generate seeds offline using entropy derived from non-computer random chance (like dice rolls).",

    'a "key sweep" is akin to guessing a password and gaining full access to an account. It means someone else now has the ability to spend the bitcoin at those keys. To sweep "all keys" means someone has the ability to spend every possible bitcoin in the space at every possible key. Sweep "All Keys" is very different from and much harder than "Sweep ONE key"',
