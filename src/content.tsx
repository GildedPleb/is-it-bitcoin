  bankSecrecyAct: `SUBCHAPTER II—RECORDS AND REPORTS ON MONETARY INSTRUMENTS TRANSACTIONS
  5311. Declaration of purpose
  It is the purpose of this subchapter (except section 5315) to require certain reports or records where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, or in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism.
  (Pub. L. 97–258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 995; Pub. L. 107–56, title III, 358(a), Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 326.)
  The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.
  ‘‘(3) FATF’s Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.
  ‘‘(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction’s financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.
  ‘‘(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficiencies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.
  ‘‘(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.
  ‘‘(7) In fulfilling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs’ work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.
  ‘‘(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SUCCESS IN MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS.—It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF 40 + 8 Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards.
  ‘‘SEC. 7702. DEFINITIONS.
  ‘‘In this subtitle [subtitle G (7701–7704) of title VII
  of Pub. L. 108–458, amending sections 262o–2 and 262r–4 of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse]—

  INTERNATIONAL MONEY LAUNDERING ABATEMENT AND FINANCIAL ANTI-TERRORISM ACT OF 2001; FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
  Pub. L. 107–56, title III, 302, Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 296, as amended by Pub. L. 108–458, title VI, 6202(c), Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3745, provided that:
  ‘‘(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—
  ‘‘(1) money laundering, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to amount to between 2 and 5 percent of global gross domestic product, which is at least $600,000,000,000 annually, provides the financial fuel that permits transnational criminal enterprises to conduct and expand their operations to the detriment of the safety and security of American citi-
  zens;
  ‘‘(2) money laundering, and the defects in financial
  transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds for terrorist attacks;
  ‘‘(3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine the integrity of United States financial institutions and of the global financial and trading systems upon which prosperity and growth depend;
  ‘‘(4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that offer ‘offshore’ banking and related facilities designed to provide anonymity, coupled with weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of criminal funds derived from, or used to commit, offenses ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;
  ‘‘(5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist organizations;
  ‘‘(6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding the identity of real parties in interest to financial transactions;
  ‘‘(7) private banking services can be susceptible to manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign government officials, particularly if those services include the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts around the globe;
  ‘‘(8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, particularly in cases in which money laundering involves foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;
  ‘‘(9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to international money launderers requires national, as well as bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially designed for that effort; and
  ‘‘(10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering principles and recommendations.
  ‘‘(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2001 Amendment note set out under section 5301 of this title] are—
  ‘‘(1) to increase the strength of United States measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism;
  ‘‘(2) to ensure that—
  ‘‘(A) banking transactions and financial relation-
  ships and the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1829b], or chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91–508 (84 Stat. 1116) [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.], or facilitate the evasion of any such provision; and
  ‘‘(B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be fulfilled, and such provisions of law are effectively and efficiently administered;
  ‘‘(3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by
  the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note) [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note set out under section 981 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure], especially with respect to crimes by nonUnited States nationals and foreign financial institutions;
  ‘‘(4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that pose particular, identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;
  ‘‘(5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title referred to as the ‘Secretary’) with broad discretion, subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative Procedure Act under title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.], to take measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts;
  ‘‘(6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by affected financial institutions;
  ‘‘(7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that are of primary money laundering concern to the United States Government;
  ‘‘(8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the
  United States permits for adequate challenge consistent with providing due process rights;
  ‘‘(9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil liability for filing suspicious activity reports;
  ‘‘(10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify that violations of such orders or any other requirement imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91–508 [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.] and subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and civil penalties;
  ‘‘(11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject to appropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial institutions with relevant reporting requirements;
  ‘‘(12) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to maintain the integrity of their employee population; and
  ‘‘(13) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such assets belong.’’

  any business described in subsection (a)(1)—
  ‘‘(A) disclose to the appropriate State agency the fees charged to consumers for services described in
  subsection (a)(1)(A); and

  location of such business, the fees charged to consumers for such services.

  ERAL CASH TRANSACTION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.—A civil or criminal penalty for operating any business referred to in paragraph (1) without establishing and complying with appropriate procedures to ensure compliance with subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code (relating to records and reports on monetary instruments transactions).

  ‘‘(i) preventing money laundering by businesses
  which are required to be licensed under any such statute; and

  story: `BIP-39, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39, is a significant protocol in the Bitcoin ecosystem, developed to enhance the security and usability of storing Bitcoin private keys. Introduced in 2013 by Marek Palatinus, Pavol Rusnak, Aaron Voisine, and Sean Bowe, it provides a standardized way to generate a mnemonic sentence—a series of easily remembered words—from a random number, which can then be used to derive a vast number of Bitcoin private keys.

  ### The Genesis of BIP-39

  The motivation for BIP-39 arose from a need to make the management of Bitcoin private keys more user-friendly and secure. Prior to BIP-39, managing cryptographic keys often involved handling long, complex strings of characters that were not only hard to remember but also easy to lose or mistype. The innovation of BIP-39 was in its ability to condense these complex keys into a mnemonic phrase, composed of simple, memorable words.

  ### How BIP-39 Works

  1. **Entropy Generation:** BIP-39 starts by generating a random number (entropy), which will dictate the security of the key. This can typically be 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits long. The more bits, the greater the security.

  2. **Mnemonic Conversion:** The entropy is then divided into chunks, and each chunk is used to select a word from a predefined list of 2048 words. For every 32 bits of entropy, an additional checksum bit is added, which helps verify the integrity of the seed and reduce the chance of error.

  3. **Seed Derivation:** The mnemonic phrase can then be combined with a passphrase (optional but recommended for additional security) to produce a seed. This seed undergoes a hashing process to generate a master key, from which all subsequent Bitcoin keys can be derived.

  ### Security Aspects

  The security of BIP-39 lies in its simplicity and the cryptographic robustness of its processes. The mnemonic phrase and optional passphrase provide two layers of security. The entropy and checksum ensure that the mnemonic is both random enough to avoid guesswork and accurate enough to prevent errors. The use of a passphrase adds an additional layer of security by augmenting the seed with a user-defined password, making brute-force attacks exponentially harder.

  ### Why It’s Amazing

  BIP-39's true innovation is its blend of security with simplicity. The mnemonic phrases it generates can be written down, memorized, or even encoded in creative ways (like a piece of art or music) and stored physically or mentally. This ability effectively means that Bitcoin keys can be hidden anywhere—in your mind, in a book, behind a painting—any place where the words can be concealed and remembered.

  ### Final Thoughts

  BIP-39 revolutionized how individuals interact with Bitcoin by reducing the barrier to entry for secure key management. It transformed the cold, unfriendly world of cryptographic keys into something accessible and even poetic, with the ability to transform a random series of bits into a series of simple words that can be your key to the Bitcoin network. This not only enhances security but also significantly expands the possibilities for storing and recovering one's digital wealth. Essentially, BIP-39 has made it possible to store vast amounts of value in a way that is both secure against digital threats and incredibly flexible in terms of physical storage and concealment.`,
